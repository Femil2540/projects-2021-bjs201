# Solow Model

This model project analyzes the Solow model with technological growth and extends it to contain a share of the population at work. The model as then analyzed for different levels of population growth to scrutinize how it affects the steady state levels of output and capital. Finally, this model project combines the extended model and the different levels for population growth to assess the overall affect for the steady state level of capital (and subsequently also for output, however, this is not show formally).

I hope you like it :)

Kind regards,
